## Description

This is intended to be a second version of my portfolio.  It will contain links to a shot informational article about me, links to my deployed projects, as well as a link to my resume and my contact informtion.  The goal of the portfolio is to provide a place to showcase my new skills, so that potential employers can have a visual representation of my skills, and learn some additional information about me.  It will also give me an easy framework to use, so I can more easily update it in the future.

I learned about building and deploying a React application, something that I will need more practice in to work with any level of confidence.  I am especially pleased that I was able to create the basic navigation functionality of the application.  It will give me a good basis to develop from.  I still need to develop the actual cards that will be used for the project tiles on the portfolio page, but really just ran out of time to complete everything.

I found it was challenging to go back to CSS after being away from it for so long!  I hope to further improve the styling on this page as well.

I look forward to using this project to continue practicing and developing my skills.
