      <p>
        As a creative person, with a lifetime love of learning, I decided to step into the world of web development.  I enjoy the process and challenges of building applications, and solving all the little puzzles along the way.  Through the UC Davis bootcamp, I have learned web development from the ground floor, starting with HTML, CSS and Javascript.  I have experience with using APIs as data resources, as well as css libraries like bootcamp.  We delved into the back end applications as well, learning Node.js, Express, MySql, MongoDB.  I have had an introduction to React as well. I am able to work on Front End and Back End web projects, and my love of learning and solving puzzles keeps me motivated to continue to learn more.
